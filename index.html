                The problems for this competition are derived for various field
                of undergraduate chemical engineering and will test your
                understanding as engineer, computing and numerical skills
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Round 1 consists of 5 questions to be solved within 24 hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You need to first register for Round 1 by 1-11-2019 and get
                  your access passcode. Round 1 will be held online and the link
                  will be made active on a weekend and all the registered
                  participants will be informed about the link and other details

                  On the Online link portal you will be asked to provide
                  specific parameter values in the question. The portal will
                  give you a positive or negative feedback based on these
                  parameter values. The feedback would be positive if the
                  parameter value asked is within some range of expected answer
                  and serves as a feedback for your code so that if the
                  concerned value asked is way off you could rework on your
                  program or concept.

              A football competition has just finished. The players have been
              given points for scoring goals and points for committing fouls.
              Now, it is up to Alex to find the best player in the tournament.
              As a programmer, your job is to help Alex by telling him the
              highest number of points achieved by some player. You are given
              two sequences A1,A2,…,AN and B1,B2,…,BN. For each valid i, player
              i scored Ai goals and committed Bi fouls. For each goal, the
              player that scored it gets 20 points, and for each foul, 10 points
              are deducted from the player that committed it. However, if the
              resulting number of points of some player is negative, this player
              will be considered to have 0 points instead. You need to calculate
              the total number of points gained by each player and tell Alex the
              maximum of these values.

              A football competition has just finished. The players have been
              given points for scoring goals and points for committing fouls.
              Now, it is up to Alex to find the best player in the tournament.
              As a programmer, your job is to help Alex by telling him the
              highest number of points achieved by some player. You are given
              two sequences A1,A2,…,AN and B1,B2,…,BN. For each valid i, player
              i scored Ai goals and committed Bi fouls. For each goal, the
              player that scored it gets 20 points, and for each foul, 10 points
              are deducted from the player that committed it. However, if the
              resulting number of points of some player is negative, this player
              will be considered to have 0 points instead. You need to calculate
              the total number of points gained by each player and tell Alex the
              maximum of these values.

              The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting
              the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

              The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.<br />
              The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.<br />
              The third line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BN.<br />
